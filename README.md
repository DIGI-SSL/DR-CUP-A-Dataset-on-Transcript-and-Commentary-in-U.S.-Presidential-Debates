# DR-CUP:<br /> A Dataset on Transcript and Commentary in U.S. Presidential Debates
## PreDeCo Dataset
In this repository, we provide the **PreDeCo** dataset, which is divided into 11 different labels and used for two tasks.<br />

The dataset was compiled using debate scripts from the **U.S. presidential election debates spanning 2016 to 2024** <br />
(as well as the Republican primary debates of 2023) and the corresponding professional commentary transcripts collected from Bloomberg.<br />

## Label Design
We have categorized these correspondences into 11 labels, which are as follows:
### (1) Key Summary:<br /> 
This label indicates that the commentator is summarizing points raised by the debate moderators or contestants.
### (2) Supplementary Explanation: <br />
This label is used when the commentator provides additional context or information sourced from experts, real-world events, or the current debate situation without expressing subjective opinions.
### (3) Commentator’s Personal Opinion: <br />
This label captures instances where the commentator voices their viewpoint on a particular issue. It includes five subcategories:<br />
- #### Performance of the Contestants:
	Evaluates how well the contestants performed during the discussion.
- #### Candidate Statements:
	Analyzes specific claims made by the contenders.
- #### Analyzing or Conclusions:
	Involves inferences or conclusions drawn by the commentator about a statement or occurrence.
- #### Market Performance:
  Pertains to comments regarding the economic performance of a nation or stock market trends.
- #### Others:
  Covers commentary on topics not addressed by the other sub-labels.
### (4) Fact-checking:
Verifies the accuracy of candidates’ statements or external rumors.
### (5) Market Reactions: 
Highlights commentary related to economic fluctuations or monetary market trends.
### (6) Public Opinion:
